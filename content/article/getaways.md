The pandemic has taken its toll on all of us, not even financially but also mentally and one of the biggest instincts we have right now is to take some time off, go on a vacation, and if not that then a holiday or a weekend getaway. We can blame this on our genes. I mean our early ancestors have been nomads, they would not settle on just one land. They roamed about, lived in different communities, had their own people , and thats how its always been. Though, now the standing on travelling has changed drastically now given our era is more privileged. 

Every cliche book or movie on travel in this century like into thin air,into the wild, wild, the way have narratives revolving around healing and finding yourself. Almost any successful billionaire you read about have been avid travellers. Phil Knight one of the founders of nike had travelled around the world before starting his own business, this is just one of the examples.These books and movies are so enjoyable, and we can easily relate to such kind of content.The reason being, we have always searched for our purpose and happiness, and travel gives you that opportunity. Travel makes you strive more for yourself.

These days travelling has morphed into hideaways.The reasons could vary. it can be that the people are either unhappy or they need a break from their regular schedule , or maybe they are burned out and need a place to think clearly, away from all the factors that do influence your situation. Whatever your reason, an unknown place can definitely be your solace, when you embrace what the place has to offer , you learn to discover yourself more. It improves your mental health even though there is discomfort, you are filled with more vigour. Since you are away from your problems atleast physically, you can tackle them with a better headspace. 

The above mentioned are for the escapists but there are others who travel to learn. They percieve the surroundings as opportunities to discover, to interact. They learn from the local people, they embrace the culture, they live as a part of the community. When a person decides to be on this kind of journey, they discover what they are made of, they learn to handle situations with a positive outlook. These people would make great story tellers, as they will have great experiences they could share.

Travelling has always been one of my favourite things to do, it is my energy boost and I realize that I want to embark on more adventurous journeys. When the world is in a better position for such activities, I would want to seek that discomfort and surrender myself to the process of travel.
